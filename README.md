<h3>Housing sales is one of the most important industries in the world, every person needs a proper house to live in. The price of the house is the most crucial part in finding a nice house. The price of the house depends not only on the condition of the house. The amount of bedrooms, bathrooms,  size of the lot, even the built year can affect the price of the house.
